I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\\\\n\\\\nBottom line, this place sucks.

I'm reviewing AVN. \\n\\nWell even though I *worked* the event this year (2012) I did *experience* the event as well because I was given a full access pass to all three floors of the event. This year that included: The Joint, Muse Hall, and Festival Hall (the \\\"novelties\\\" aka sex toys floor). AVN took place, for the first time, at Hard Rock Hotel. AVN noted they did this because they \\\"wanted to take over an entire casino\\\". Well, they definitely did.\\n\\nI worked information booth and happened to notice a lot of people confused as to what they could and could not see. I often felt bad because people thought they could go somewhere, but were denied access. The line to get tickets was OUTSIDE of Hard Rock, in the front of the hotel, and from what I have heard, extended forever and the wait was up to two hours for some to get tickets.\\n\\nLook, I'd never willingly go to a porn convention, but since I had all access I figured I'd check it out. Come on, it's the PORN CONVENTION. Basically porn stars signing autographs, companies selling sexy items, and girls getting half naked. I'll admit my favorite part of the convention was actually the Sapphire Gentleman's Lounge, who had strippers getting down in the hallway between the floors.\\n\\nOf course, you can collect many goodies to take home with you and some are up for purchase as well. I also gained access to the International Trade Show Floor, which shows you just what's up in the land of erotica in different countries.\\n\\nThe Hard Rock for 4 days straight was taken over by porn stars, a lot of dudes, and people just curious, or people serious about sex, porn, and et cetera. \\n\\nI personally thought it was confusing for people though and cramped as could be. AVN should reconsider the location for next year.</td>\n",

There are various artworks and numerous ceramics by the Spanish Master located in the restaurant.

It is perfection.  Yes, perfection!!  Imagine eating something that could not have been cooked or could not have tasted any better.  That is Picasso for you.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and all the sauces and flavors were perfect.  Nothing was too chewy or too dry or too salty.  The oysters and foie gras were like Heaven in my mouth.  The lobster option had an extra charge, but it was worth the extra money paid.  My taste buds have never been so happy.  Everything was PERFECT! \\n\\nThe ambiance is extremely upscale and romantic.  If you can get a terrace or window seat, you have the best seats in the restaurant.  \\n\\nService was excellent.  Fast and attentive.  I asked where the restroom was located and the server escorted me all the way to the restroom.  When I returned, my table napkin was refolded for me and the seating area had looked like I just arrived.  Then, here comes the server to help me push my chair in behind me.  Why, thank you :)  So fancy!\\n\\nThis place is very pricey, but I think it is perfection and worth every penny.  I have been to many other upscale restaurants, where the food did not taste as good and was still pricey.  I would rather save my pennies and have perfection here.\\n\\nHAPPY PICASSOING!!!</td>\n",

When we said we weren't ready to buy, they didn't pressure us at all, just told us to come back or call anytime we have any questions. Seriously the best experience I've ever had at a car lot. It is worth mentioning that we worked with Bob the salesman, and that the manager/owner also talked with us for a bit.
